# Java Fundamentals
In the world of programming, there's frequent upgrading of languages and technologies. With the new, the old has to go. At times, the evolvement of a language is so drastic that it renders the knowledge of programming in the old version almost useless. Developers have to learn everything from scratch. This is exhaustive.
With Java, it's a bit different. It's been decades since Java made an entry into the programming world. However, Java programmers just had to build upon the knowledge of the prior versions when a new version is launched. So, in every sense, becoming a Java developer is a good bet. 
The common notion regarding Java is that it's a complex language to learn. Not so with this course. This course with a blend of different learning tools makes learning Java an interesting affair.
There's a growing trend of developers wanting to make a mark in the Android market. Android programming has Java in its roots. This course will provide you with the right start to learning the specifics of writing Android applications.



## What you will learn
* This course is more of a hand-on, practical guide than a theoretical one. A quick introduction of Java includes writing simple Java programs within no time.
* All the meat of the language, such as data types, data structures, and control flow are explained justifiably so that you don't miss out on the important language-building concepts.
* OOP is explained in depth, with emphasis on typecasting, abstract classes, and interfaces.
* You'll create your own Generics, and learn to handle exceptions.



### Hardware requirements
For an optimal student experience, we recommend the following hardware configuration:
* Processor: Intel Core i7 or equivalent
* Memory: 8 GB RAM
* Storage: 35 GB available space
* An Internet connection



### Software requirements
Youâ€™ll also need the following software installed in advance:
* Operating System: Windows (8 or higher)
* Operating system: Windows 7 or above
* Java 8 JDK
* IntelliJ IDEA
